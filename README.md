# Simple Password Generator

This is my **very first code project**, and I definitely changed the code *a lot* to make it look better while still running exactly how it should. I built it using Python, VS Code, & Replit. 

It was a great hands-on way to teach myself how to: 
    - Write funcitons
    - Handle user input
    - Work with loops & conditions
    - Add error handling
    - And just get comfortable actually coding and seeing it run!


What This Code does:

    This script generates secure, randomzied passwords using Python's build in 'secerts' module. Which is rather secure than using the 'random' module.

    The user enters how long they want the password to be, and the program returns a STRONG password made of:
     - Uppercase & Lowercase Letters
     - Numbers
     - Symbols

Features:
    - Very simple to use
    - Cryptographically Secure
    - Keeps running until you decide to quit
    - Validates input and handles errors
    - Full of comments so it's easy to understand
